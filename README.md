# Predicting User Intents and Musical Attributes from Music Discovery Conversations

Here is the implementation code and data for the paper titled **"Predicting User Intents and Musical Attributes from Music Discovery Conversations"** by Daeyong Kwon, SeungHeon Doh, Juhan Nam, 2024

## Setting

The packages and version information required for the implementation are stored in the **requirements.txt** file.

## Implementation

Sparse representation, Word Embedding (Word2Vec), DistilBERT_Probing, DistilBERT_Finetune, and Llama are each implemented in separate .py files. The **functions.py** file should be placed in the same directory to import data preprocessing functions.

Each .py file can be executed by running ```python filename.py```, and the resulting .csv files will be saved in the **"./results"** directory.
